# My DevOps Learning Journey

## Introduction
Welcome to my DevOps learning journey! This README.md file serves as a guide to track my progress and document my experiences as I explore various DevOps tools and concepts.

2. [Day 1](#day-1)
3. [Day 2](#day-2)
4. [Next Steps](#next-steps)

## Overview
In this repository, I'll be documenting my journey as I learn DevOps practices and technologies. I'll be covering topics such as shell scripting, Linux commands, containerization, continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), infrastructure as code (IaC), and more.

## Day 1
### Deployed my first pipeline as code
- Details can be found in the Jenkins Folder.

## Day 2
### Explored Docker and Containerization
- Created a React app and containerized it using Docker.
- Built a Docker image and ran the container on the server.
- Enhanced the README.md file with explanations on the topics covered.

## Next Steps
For Day 3, I plan to explore Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications and delve into Kubernetes for container orchestration. Additionally, I'll continue to explore advanced Docker features and other DevOps tools and practices.

Feel free to follow along with my journey or contribute to the repository!
